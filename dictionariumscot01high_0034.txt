In the singular, final n of the article is sometimes
cut off, and its absence marked by an apostrophe.
The same happens to the initial a of the dative sin-

gular.

cHAP. 11.-0F NOUNS.

A Noun is the Name of any person, object, or
thing whatsoever‚ that we have occasion to mention.
In treating of this Part of Speech, we have to eon-
sider the Gender and the Doelensimi of Nouus.

01³ GENDER.

The following observations may serve to give some
idea of the analogy of gender in Gaelic nouns ; though
they do not furnish a complete set of rules sufficient
to ascertain the gender of every noun.

MAscumxxzs. Nouns signifying males are mascu-
lines; as ‘ fear’ a man, ‘ righ’ α kiny, ‘ sagart’ α
priest, ‘ tarbh' α hall, ‘ csi' α eloy.

Many nouns, signifying the young of animals of
either Sex, arc masculine, even when the indivrdual
objects they denote are mentioned as being of the
female Sex; as ‘ laogh' α calt‘, ‘ isean' α dickele,
‘ uan' a lamb, ἃς.

Diminutives in an ; as ‘ rothan' a little wlteel,
¹ dcalgan' a little pin, ἃς.

Derivatives in as, which are, for the most part, ab·
straet nouns; as ‘ cairdeas' friemlslcip, ¹ naimhdeas'
cumitgh ‘ cisiineas' calmness, ‘ breitheanas' jadq-
mem, ‘ ceartas' justice, ‘ maitheas’ (medates, διε.

Dcrivativcs in air, ach, iclte, which are, for the
most part, agents: as ¹ cealgair' α dominer, ‘ sealg-
nir' a lutum-man, ‘ dorsair' a door-lieepcr, ‘ marcach‘ a
ritler, ⁴ inaraiche' a sailor, ‘ coisiche' afhol-traz·eller,
&tn

Names of such kinds of trees ns are nativos of Scot-
land ; ns ‘ darach* oak, ‘ giubhas' fir, ‘ uinnseann'
asle.

Most polysyllables whereof the last vowel is broad,
:irc masculine.

FEMiNlNES. Nouus signil'ying semales are semi-
nine; us ¹ bcan' a woman, ‘ niathair' a mother, ‘ bo'
u cow, ἃς. Except ‘ bainionnach' or ‘ boirionnnch'
uscnmlc, ¹ inart' α cmv, ‘ capull' (ι horse or mure, hut
commonly n mare, which are masculine ; and ‘ cuil-
ἰη’ a clmmrl, masculine or icininine.

suun· iunius· ‹li-nuting n specics arc flaminino, even l it a dill'crcnt name.

OF THE PARTS 01³ SPEECH.

PART. 11.

‘ Gealach' moon.

Names of diseases; as ‘ teasach‘ a sever, ι a'
gliriuthach’ tlte measks, ‘ a’ bhreac’ the small-pax,
¹ a‘ bhuidheach’ tlaejaundice, ‘ a' bhuinneach' a diarr-

Collective names of trees or shrubs are feminine;

brake.

Diminutives in a95 as ‘ caileag’ a girl, ‘ cuachag'

Abstract nouns formed from the genitive of adjec-
tives; as ‘ doille’ blindness, ‘ gile’ whiteness, ‘ leisg'
laziness, ‘ buidhre’ deusneSS, &c-

Many monosyllables in ua followed by one or
more consonants are feminine; as ‘ bruach’ a bank,
‘ cruach' a heap, ‘ cuach’ a cup, ⁶ cluas’ an ear,
‘ gruag' the hair of the head, ‘ sguab’ a slteafi
‘ tuadh' α hate-het, ‘ tuath’ peasantry.

Almost all polysyllables, whereof the last vowel is
small, except those in air and iche, already noticed‚
are feminine.

A few nouns are of either gender; ‘ Salm' a Psalm,
‘ creidimh’ belief, are used as masculine nouns in
some places, and feminine in others. ‘ Cruinne’ tlte
=qlohe, ‘ talamh‘ the earth, land, are masculine in the
nominative; as ‘ an cruinne-ce’ the qlohe of the earth.
The same nouus are generally feminine in the ge-
nitive3 as ‘ gu erich na eruinne’ to tlte eoetremz'ty of

the >ww-ld. ‘ aghaidh na talmhainn‘ tlte face of the
eart ι.

OF DECLENSION.

Nouns undergo, certain changes significant of Num-
ber and of Relation.

The forms significant of Number are two ε the Sin-
ffltlar, which denotes one ; and the Plural, which de-
notes any number greater than one.

The changes expressive of Relation are made on
nouns in two ways: 1. On the beginning of the
noun; 2. On its termination. The relations de-
noted by changes on the termination are different
from those denoted by changes on the beginning;
they have no necessary connection together3 the
one may take place in absence of the other. It
seems proper therefore to class the changes on the
termination by themselves in one division, and give
it a namen and to class the changes on the beginning
also by themselves in another division, and give

and Latin, to signify ⁴ the changes made on the ter-
