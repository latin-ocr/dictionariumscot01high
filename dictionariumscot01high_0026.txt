xviii INTRODUCTION.

translated in the First Part. It is hoped that discrepancies are rare ; and the translation
of the English Vocabulary into Gaelic, being to the compiler a work more of memory
and of praetical knowledge of Gaelic, than of study or research, the suggestions of memor-y
have been adopted without fear of any considerable error; and thus shades of difference
may frequently occur, between the meanings ascribed to a Gaelic merdin the First and the
Second Pans. It must also be borne in mind, that in the work of a translation so minute
and particular as of the words of one language in detail into another, it is absolutely more
than ean be achieved by the utinost faithfulness, on the part of the translator, to find
words in the one language, exactly corresponding to every word and meaning of a word
that is of current use in the other. In the present work also there was added to this dif-
ficulty, the comparative want of copiousneSS, that must necessarily be supposed to exist 111
the Gaelic language, so much less cultivated as it, is, and umnodelled to the necessities, the
terms, phraseology and usages of the English, in arts, in scienceS, in abstract discourse,
in disquisitions, in the style and habits of conversation and writing. The fulness that has
been given to the Second Part, the English and Gaelic Vocabulary, has also regard to tho
practical use of the Work 1ο the student of Gaelic as a spoken and written language3 and
to such it is hoped an aid has been offered, which hitherto has been almost wholly denied
to him.

The Third Part of the Work consists of a Latin Vocabulary, translated into Gaelic.
ln this, it has been the desire of the compilerS‚ to unite conciseness with aceuracy and
sufficient fulness3 but it has not been herc considered expedient to exhaust the Voca-
bulary of the Latin language. Many of its'derivative and compound words, of its tech-
nical ternis and of its foreign additions from other lang-nages, have been omitted, as serv-
ing none of the purposes for which this work is intended. In all the words judged neces-
sary to be inserted, the different leading significations have been regarded3 these are illus-
trated by the shortest possible explanation, and the corresponding Gaelic word or phrase is
given 111 its place. The two latter parts of the work will, according to the circumstances
in which thc readcr is placed, help to conduct him at once to the Gaelic word in the First
Part ; under which all the necessary explanations are to be found.

'she compendium of Grammar prefixed to the Dictionary will be found an abridged
transcript os that formerly published by Dr. Stewart3 the incontestable merits of whose work.
as a (iranunar of the langnage, have been universally admitted. It was intended, that an Ap-
pendix should he added to the Dictionary, explanatory of names of places of Celtic origin,
both in the Ilighlands of scotland and other parts of the kingdom ε but it was eventually
found that such an addition would infringe upon the 11111113, that had already been prescrib-
cd to the work 3 and that, to do justice to thc subject intended, interesting and curious 111
mels, a separate volume would hc more appropriate: this, it is probable, may at some future
period appi-ar, as a suitahle companion to the Dictionary.
