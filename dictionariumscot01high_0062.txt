SECTION Ι.

OF THE GovERxMENT OF NOUNS.

One Noun governs another in the Genitive. Thte
Noun gorerned is always placed after that which go-
verns it ; as ⁴ ceann tighe’ the head <ff α house or'fa-
⁴ 171in .· ‘ solus na greine' Hyla ‘ff tlte sun ; ‘ hamne
ghabhar' milk ofyoats. ¹ ῃ

The Infinitives‚ or present participles, of Transmve
Verbs, being themselves Nouns, govern in like man-
ner the Genitive of their object ; as ‘ ag cur sil’ sote-³⁷19
seed, ‘ a dh' fhaicinn an t-sluaigh’ co see the people, ‘alr
leughadh an t-soisgeil' after readinq the qospel.

Although no good reason appears why this rule,
which is common to the Gaelic with many other lan-
guages, should ever be set aside; yet it has been
set aside in speaking, and sometimes in writing
Gaelic.

l. When the Noun governed does in its turn go-
vern another Noun in the Genitive‚ the former is of-
ten put in the Nominative instead of the Genitive
[use.

2. Such expressions as the following seem to be
exceptions to the rule; ‘ dithis mac', ⁴ ceathrar mac’,
⁶ leanabaibh mac'.-—1n the following similar instances,
the rule is observed ; ‘ dithis mhac’3 ‘ dithis fhear'.

The same anomaly takes place in the regimen of
the Infinitive, asin that of other Nouns. Though an
Infinitive be in that grammatical relation to a preced-
ing Noun which would require its being put in the
Genifive: yet when itself also governs another noun
in the Genitire, it often retains the form of the No-
minative.

The Infinitive is not put in the Genitive, when pre-
ceded by a Possessive Pronoun, because it is in the
same limited state as if it governed a noun in the
Genitive Case ; as ‘ a chum am marbhadh 's na beannt-
aibh'‚ lo kil! them in tlte mmmtains. Not ‘marbliaidh’,
which is the Case regularly governed by ‘chum'.
‘ Co tha 'g iarraidh do mharbhadh'? wlco sechem to
hill llice 2

When one Noun governs another in the Genitive,
the Articlc is never joined to both, even though each
hc limitcd in its signification; as ‘ mac an righ' the
son nstlu· liius), not ‘ am mac nn righ' ; ⁴ taohh deas a'
hhailc' llic mulli sida qs the eoum, not ‘ un taohh deas
η’ hhailc'. l·'or the most part, the Articlc is thus
joint-d to the latter noun. Sometimes it is joined to
ihc sorim-r noun; ns ‘ an ccann tighc' the laetu! (gf the
fiunily, ¹:111 ccann istil' {hc pilot.

A Postu-«sive l'ronoun joined to the Noun governcd
excludi-⁶⁸, in like ninum-r, thc Articlc from thc noun
goxrrning ; au ‘ lmrr-inll u bhrbigv' tlte Iam-hrt qs his
xlm. not ¹ nm bnrr-inll ιι inninga—3 ‘ ohair hhur
Ι.ιιιι1ι“ thr wnrle ‹gsymlr hands, not ‘ an obuir bhur
Ι.ιιιιΙι.“

ἸἸιι- Noun goram-d is sorni-times in the l’rirnary,
—nnn tim( *k in tlu- Aspirntvd form.

brother ; ‘ uaigh Choluim’ Columba's yrave. Except
when a final and an initial Lingua} meet; as ⁴ clann
Domhnuill’Donald's descendants ; ‘ beinn Deirg’ Dar-
o's hill.

9 When both Nouns are Appeuatives, and no word
intervenes between them ; the initial Form of the lat-
ter noun follows, for the most part, that of an Adjec-
tive agreeing with the former noun.

Excsspr. If the latter Noun denote an individual
of a species, that is, if it take the Article a before it
in English, itis put in the primam form, although the
former Noun be feminine; as ‘ suil caraid' the eye ῳ(
ιι friend, not ‘ stul ckaraid’.

SECTION ΙΙ.

oF THE GOVERNMENT OF ADJECTIVES.

Adjectives of fulness govern the Genitive; as ⁶ lan
uamhainn' full of dread, ‘buidheach bldh’ satifffied
with meat.

The first Comparative takes the Particle ‘ na' tltan,
before the following Noun; as ‘ ni ‘s gile fia an
sneachdadh’ whiter than the εηοτυς ‘ b’·fhaide gach
mios na bliadhna’ each numm seemed lonqer than a

ear.

y The second Comparative is construed thus; ⁴ is
feaird mi so’, I am the better sbr tlzz's; ‘ bu mhisd’
e a’ bhuille sin’, lte was tlte worse for that blow.

Superlatives are followed by the Preposition ‘ de'
or ⁶ dhe’ qf',· as ‘ am fear a ’s airde dhe 'n triuir’ the
man wlco is tallestqf the three, the tallest man ⁰f tlte
three.

SECTION 111.

OF THE GOVERNMl-:NT OF VERBS.

A Transitive Verb governs its object in the Nomi-'
native or Objective Case3 as ‘ mharbh iad an Righ‘
they kilkd tlte kiny, ‘ na buail mi’ do not strike me. The
object is commonly placed after the Verb ; but never
between the Verb and its Nominative. Sometimes
the object is placed, by way of emphasis, before the
Verb; as ‘ mise chuir e ris ann arn aite, agus esan
chroch e' me Ιιε put ayaz'n in my place, and him lle
lcauyed.

Many Transitive Verbs require a Preposition before
their object3 us ‘ iarr air Domhnull' desire Donum,-
‘ lahhair ri Domhnull’ §peak ιο Donald; ‘leig le Domh-
null' let DmmId alone ,· ‘ beannuich do Dhomhnull' sa-
lute Dmmld ,· ‘ fiosraich de Dhomhnull' inquire qs
Dmmld.

‘ Bu' nms, requires the following initia} Consonant
to bc aspirate‹l; as ‘ bu mhaith (lhuit' it mas qoodfhr
Ιηοιι ; ‘ bu chruaidh an gnothuch' i! was (ι hard case,-
cxcept initiul d. nnd twhich are not aspirated; as
‘ hu ‹lual ‹luit' it was nacnralsor you.
