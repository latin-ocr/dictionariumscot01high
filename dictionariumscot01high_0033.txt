PART 1.

Or L, N, R.

A distinction between a consonant when plain, and
the same consonant when aspirated, has been easily
traced thus Far. This distinction readily discovers it-
self, not only in the pronunciation and orthography,
but also (as will be seen in its proper place) through-
out the system of inflection. It takes place uniform-
ly in those consonants which have been already con-
sidered. With respect to the remaining linguals, l, n,
r, a corresponding distinction will be found to take
place in their pronunciation, and likewisc in the
changes they suffer by inflection. This close corres-
pondence between the changes incident to l, π, r, and
the changes which the other consonants undergo,
seems to be a sufficient reason for still using the
same discriminative terms in treating of their powers ;
though these terms may not appear to be so strictly
applicable to these three consonants as to the rest.
The powers of l, n, r, shall accordingly be explained
under the divisions plain and aspirated, broad and
small.

L

1. Plain. Broad; has no sound like it in English;
‘ lom‘ bare, ‘ labhair’ qwak, ‘ mall' slow, ‘ alt’ a joint,
⁴ alt' a brook, ‘ slat' a rod, ‘ dla' near.

2. Small: like ll in million; as ‘ linn' an aye,
‘ llon’fill, ‘ pill return, ‘ slighe' a way.

3. Aspirated. Broad: like l in loom, βιοῖ,- as
⁴ labhair' spelte, ⁶ lom' feminine of ‘ lom’ bare, ‘ mol’

. ι ,‚ - . c t,
etfama? ‚sarira fl a,
his aye, ⁴ lion’ filled, ‘ mil’ honey, ⁶ dligheach’ dae,
lawsul.
N

1. Plain. Broad; has no sound like it in English;

‘ nuadh' new, ‘ naisg' hind, ‘ lann’ a blade, ⁴ carn' a

heap ofstones.
2. Small .· like n in the second syllable of opinion ,-

 

OF PRONUNCIATION ΛΝΒ ORTHOGRAPHY. 5

as ‘ nigh' wash, ‘ binn’ melodious, ‘ cuirn’ heaps of
stones.

3. Aspirated. Broad: like n in no, on ‚· as ‘ huadh'
feminine of ¹ nuadh' new, ‘ fiaisg' bound, ‘ shnamh'
swam, ‘ sean’ old, ‘ chon’ ffdoys, ⁴ dan’ a poem.

4. Small .· like η in heen, near ‚· as ¹ 1'1igh’ weaslieas,
‘ shniomh‘ miscell, ‘ coin' cloys, ‘ dain’ poems.

In ‘ an’ when followed by a Palatal, the n is pro-
nounced like 715] in English3 as ‘an gille’ the lad,
‘ an cdmhnuidh’ always.

N, after a mute, is in a few instances pronounced
like r as in ‘ mnathan’ women, ‘ enatan⁷ a cold, ‘ an
t-snath' of the yarn ; pronounced ‘ mrathan, cratan,'
διο.

R

1. Plain. Nearly like ν in roar ,· as ‘ ruadh’ red-
dish, ‘ righ' a hiuy, ‘ ruith’ rme, ‘ torr’ a heap,
‘ ceartas’ justice.

2. Aspirated. Broad .· nearly like final r in rear ‚-
‘ as car' a turn, ‘ ruith’ ran, ‘ moi-⁹ yreat.

3. Small: has no sound like it in English3 ‘ a righ'
O hiwy, ‘ seirbhe’ satiety, ‘ moir’ gen. of ‘ mor’ qreat.

RULE, L, N, R, have their PLAIN sound when, in
the same syllable, they are immediately preceded by a
plain Liquid, or immediately followed by a plain Lin-
yual ; also in the beyinniwy of certain cases and tenses ‚-
in all other situations, they have their ASPIRATED
sound. They have their sMALL sound when, in the
same syllable, they are preceded or followed by a small
vowel, with or without an interis-enioy Lz'quz'd ; in other
situations, they have their BROAD sound.

H

H is never used as an independent radical letter.
When prefixed to a word beginning with a vowel, it
is pronounced like Ῐι in how ‚· as ⁶ na 11-6ighean’ the
vir-qius, ‘ na h-oidhche’ of the niyht.

PART II.
OF THE PARTs OF SPEECH.

ΤΗΕ parts of speech in Gaelic may be conveniently
divided and arranged as follows : Article, Noun, Ad-
jective, Pronoun, Verb, Adverb, Preposition, Con-
junction, Interjection. Of these, the first five are de-
clinable; the other four are indeclinable.

 

CHAP. L—OF THE ARTICLE.

Tm: Gaelic Article ⁵ an' corresponds to the Eng-
lish definite article the. There is in Gaelic no inde-

finite article corresponding to the English a or an.
The inflections of the article are but few. They de-
pend on the gender, the number, and the case-of the
noun to which it is prefixed. Hence the article is
declined by gender, number, and case, as follows 2

Singular. Plural.
masc. fem. maso. distem.
Nom. an, am an, a’ na
Gen. an, a' na nan, nam
Dat. an, a’, 'n an, a', ’n na
