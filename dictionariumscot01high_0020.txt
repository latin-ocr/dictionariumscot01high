xii INTRODUCTION.

the latter translation seemed essentially requisite. When a word is found to have dif-
ferent significations, these are distinguished numerieally by figures; and the authority,
when found in writing, follows each interpretation in its place. It is here willingly con-
ceded‚ that a strict etymological survey of the words in this work, may afford an apparent
ground for questioning whether the primary and derivative meanings have had their pro-
'per places assigned them. Besides however this being held by the compilers a mat-
ter of minor iniportance, while all the various meanings, in number, are attended τος
it is true of the Gaelic language, and, to some extent, of every other, that the primary
meaning in use differs often and widely from the primary etymologica] meaning3 and
that the seeondary meanings also have not multiplied in regular succession from
the primary, but have been adopted by accidents and circumstances, attendant upon
the manners and history of the people, more interesting to contemplate, than easy
to trac-e with any certainty and precision. In a language where literature has
abounded, and of which authentic reeords are preserved, these furnish landmarks to the
lexicographer and the etymologist, guiding them to the roots and true primary mean-
ings of words 3 but as in Gaelic, where such helps are very scant-ily afforded, it is doing
the most that ean well bc achieved, to follow the order that is known in the practice of
speech, as to the more common, and the less common uses and meanings of words. The
various significations and meanings, when distinctly noted, though apparently departing in
theory from their legitimate order, will not, on that account be less useful to the phi-
lologist‚ in his endeavours to trace the connection osone language with another.

An important part of the‘present work has been, the selection of proper examples for
the uses of words, from genuine compositions in the Scoto-Gaelic tongue, and from the
phraseologies of modern speech. In every light in which the purposes of lexicography are
to he viewed‚ whether of a dead or a living language, it is the exhibition of such examples‚
that gives to it confirmation and value. The aids that could be derived from written com-
positionis were hut scanty: these have, however, been explored with care. Among the
few printed volumes that exist in the language, besides the translation of the Scriptures,
the character of those volumes, and the materials of which they are composed, did not
always admit of their being used with propriety or advantage. ΤΙιθγ chiefly consist of
poeti-y, in fugitive pieces and on local subjects, which, however well understood by and in-
teresting to the nativos of the country, would render any attempt at their translation un-
availing, if not hulicrous3 or would at least render necessaryaperiphrastic mode of trans-
ferring rhein into English and Latin, more fatiguing to the reader and cumbrous to the
work, than useful or profitable, in a faithful exhibition of the language. Nor need it be
eoncealffll, that. the lnnnhle origin of such works, and the limited knowledge of their
authors, untrained in the courtesies of politer literature, have rendered the breath-
ings os their niuse, in too inany instanccs, unworthy of record. That poetic genius
and lire were vom-hsased to the Scot()-Cclt5‚ is not meant to be denied: enough, it is
premium-«l, has been recorded in the present work, to vindicate the general character,
