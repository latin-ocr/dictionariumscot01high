CHAP. IV.—OF PRONOUNS.

Tm: Pronouns are, for the most part, words used
instead of nouns. They may be arranged under the
following divisions: Personal, Possessive, Relative,
Demonstrative‚ Interrogative, Indefinste, Compound.

The Personal Pronouns are those of the lst‚ ed,
and 3d persons. They have a Singular and a Plural
Numbena Simple and an Emphatic Form. They are
declined thus :

Singular.

OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH. 13

The Pronoun ‘ sibh' you, of the plural number is
used almost universally in addressing a single person
of superior rank, or of greater age ; while ‘ thu’ thou, of
the singular number is used in addressing an inferior
or an equal. But the degree os seniority or of supe-
riority, which is understood to entitle a person to
this token of respect, varies in different parts of the
Highlands. The Supremo Being is always addressed

by tlsse pronoun ‘ tu', or, ⁵ thu', thou, of the singular
num er.

The Possesive Pronouns correspond to the Person-
al Pronouns3 and, like them, may be called those of
the 1st‚2d‚ and 3d persons singular, and lst‚ Qd,
and 3d persons plural. They have an emphatic
Form, which is made by connecting the syllable sa
with the possessive pronoun of the lst, ed, and 3d
persons singular, and Qd person plural ς ne with that
of 'the lst person plural, and san with that of 3d per-
son plural. These syllables are placed immediately
after the nouos to which the possessive pronouns are
prefixed, and connected by a hyphen.

These Pronouns are as follows:

Sa· m ple. Em plantio.

Singular.

l. Mo, my, mo mbae-sa.

2. Do, thy, do mhac-sa.

3 A, his, a mbae-sa, or, san.
‘ A, her, a mac-sa, or, san.

Plural.

l. Ar, our, ar mac-ne.
2. Bhur, ὐπ’, your, bhur mac-sa.
3. An, am, their, an, am-sa, san.

If the noun be followed by an adjective, the em-
phatic syllable is affixed to the adjective; as ‘ do
lamh gheal-sa’ thy white hand.

The possessive pronouns, ‘ mo, do', when followed
by a vowel, commonly lose the o, whose absence is
marked by an apostrophe; as ζ m’ ainm’ my name,-
‘ d’ athair' thy ficther. ‘ Do’, thus abbreviated is fre-
quently changed into, t’. The same pronouns when
preceded by the preposition ⁶ ann' in, suffer a trans-
position oftheir letters, and are written ‘ am, ad’, one
broad vowel being substituted for another; as ‘ ann
ad chridhe' in tlzy beart, ‘ann am aire’ in my lhouylzts.

The possessive pronoun ‘ a’ leis, is often suppressed
altogether after a vowel; as ‘ na sanntaich bean do
choimhearsnaich‚ no oglach,no bhanoglach, no dhamh,
no asal’ συνεί not tlty neiylaebours wffe, or his man·
servant, or his maid-servant, ἃς. When thus omitted,
its absence is marked by an apostrophe before the
initial letter of the following noun, ‘ no 'oglach‚ no
‘ bhanoglach’.

The word ‘ fein’ corresponding to the English
words sels, own, is subjoined occasionally both to the
personal and possessive pronouns; thus ‘ mi fein’
myself, ‘ mise fein¹ Imyseff, ‘ thu fein' thysegf, ‘ thusa
fein‘ thou thy-§effi or thy own sels,- ‘ mo shluagh fein'
my own people.
