SECTION IV.

OF ΤΗΣ GOVERNMENT OF ADVERBS.

The collocation of Adverbs is for the most part ar-
bitrar .

Thg' Adverbs ⁶ ro, gle' very, are placed before the
Adjectives they modify, and require the following
initial Consonant to be aspirated3 as ⁶ ro bheag’ very
little, ⁶ gle gheal' very white.

The negative ⁶ cha’ not, when followed by a word
beginning with a Labial or Palatal, requires the
initial Consonant to be aspirated3 as ‘cha mbor e’
it is not ffl‘ffl‘i ⁶ cha bhuajl mi’ I will not Serme,-
‘ cha chuala mi’ I did not hear ,· but an initial Lin-
gual remains unaspirated; as ⁶ cha detm mi' I will
not do, ⁶ cha tog e' lae will not mise, ⁶ cha soirbhich
iad‘ they will not prosper. N is inserted between ⁶ cha’
and an initial Vowel or an aspiratedf,· as ⁶ cha n-e’
ic is not, ⁶ cha n-eigin’ ic is not necessary, 6 cha n-fhaca
mi' I saw not.

The Negative ⁶ ni' requires Ῐι before an initial
Vowel; as ‘ ni h-iad' they are not, ⁶ ni h-eudar’ it may
not.

SECTION V·

ΟΕ THE GOVERNMENT OF PREPOSITIONS.

The Ptoper Prepositions ⁶ aig, air’, ἃς. govern the
Dative3 as ⁶ aig mo chois' αι my feet, ⁶ air mo laimh’
on my hand. They are always placed before the
word they govern. The following prepositions re-
quire the Noun governed to be put in the Aspirated
Form, viz. ⁶ de, do, fuidh, fo, fa, gun, mar, mu, o,
tre'. ⁶ Air’ sometimes governs the Noun in the As-
pirated Form; as ⁶ air bharraibh sgiath na gaoithe’
on tlte extremities of tlae winys of tlte wind.—‘ Gun’
governs either the Nominative or Dative; as ⁶ gun
chrIoch' without end. ⁶ Gun cheill’ without under-
standiny. ⁶ Gun chloinn’.-—-⁶ Mar‘, and ‘ gus’ or ⁶ gu’
when prefixed to a Noun without the Article, usual-
ly govern the Dative case3 as ⁶ mar nighin' as α
dauqlzter. ⁶ Mar amhainn mhoir' like a yreat river.
⁶ Gu erich mo shaoghail fein' to tlte end of my 'fi‘
time. But if the Article be joined to the Noun, it
is governed in the Nominative; as ⁶ mar a’ ghrian’
like the sun. ⁶ Gus an sruth’ to tlte stream. ⁶ Gus a’
chrioch’ to the end—⁶ Eadar' governs the Nom. as
⁶ eadat a' ehraobh agus a' chlach' between the tree and
tlte stone. ⁶ Eadar‘, when signifying between, requires
the Primary Form ; as ⁶ eadar maighstir agus muinn-
tearach' between α master and α servant.- when it sig-
nifies both, it requires the Aspirated Form ; as ⁶ eadar
shean agus ὅς’ both old and youn9; ⁶ eadar fheara
agus mhnai’ botlzmen and women.

The Poepositions ‘as‚ gus, leis, iis’, are used be-

fore the Monosyllables ⁶ an, am, a’. The correspond-
ing Prepositions ‘ 5, gu, le, r·i'‚ often take an Iz before
an initial Vowel ; as ⁶ ἃ h-Eirin’ out osli-eland ,· ⁶ gu
h—ealamh‘ readily ; ⁶ ie h-eagal’ utitlzfiar.

The Improper Prepositions govern the following
Noun in the Genitive ; as ⁶ air feadh na tire’ tlcrouyln-
out the land ; ⁶ an aghaidh an t-sluaigh’ against the
people,· 6 re na h-uine' duriny the time. It is mani-
fest that this Genitive is governed by the Noun
⁶ feadh, aghaidh, re'‚ ἃς. which is always included in
the Preposition.

Prepositions are often prefixed to a clause of a
sentence; and then they have no regimen; as ⁶ gus
am bord a ghiulan’ to carry the table. ⁶ Luath chum
fui] a dhortadh’ swg'ft to sked blood. ⁶ An deigh an
obair a chriochnachadh’ ofterfinislaeiny tlte work.

SECTION. VI.

OF THE GOVERNMENT OE· CONJUNCTIONS.

The Conjunctions ⁶ agus’ and, ⁶ no' or, eouple the
same Cases of Nouns; as ⁶ air feadh chreagan agus
choilltean’ throuylz rocks and woods ,· ⁶ ag reubadh
nain bruach 's nan crann’ tear-inq tlte banks and tlte
trees. When two or more Nouns, coupled by a Con-
junction, are governed in the Dative by a Preposi·
tion, it is usual to repeat the Preposition before each
Noun; as ‘ air fad agus air leud’ in lenytb and in
breadtlz ; 6 ’n an cridhe ’n an cainnte, agus 'n am beus’
in tlzeir heare, in their speech, and in their behaviour.

⁶ Co', or ⁶ cho’, as, prefixed to an Adjective, com-
monly requires the initial consonant of the Adjective
to be aspirated3 as ⁶ co mhaith’ as qood, 6 co ghrinn'
as fine. But sometimes we find ⁶ cho mor’ as meac,
⁶ cho buan’ as dumble, &c. without the aspirate.

The Conjunctions ⁶ mur’ (snat, ⁶ gu, gur’ that, are
always joined to the Negative Mood; as ⁶ mur ’eil
mi' {f Ibe not; 6 gu robh e’ that lle was. M or η is
often inserted, euphoniae causa, between ⁶ gu’ and an
initial Consonant3 viZ. m before a Labial, n before a
Palatal or a Lingual ; as ⁶ gu-m faca tu' that you δαῖε),-
‘ gu-ri dubhairt iad‘ tltat they said.

The Conjunctions ⁶ ma’ if, ⁶0, o’n' bec-muse, since,
are joined to the Pres. and Pret. Affirmative, and Fut.
SubjunctiVe ; as ⁶ ma ta e’ ff he be, ⁶ o'n tha e’ since
he is,· ⁶ ma bhuail e' if ke struck ,· ⁶ o’n bhuail c’ be-
cause Ize struck ; ⁶ ma bhuaileas tu' {f you strike ; ⁶ ο
bhitheas sinn' since we shall be.

6 Nam, nan’ if, is joined only to the Pret. Subjunc-
tive. The initial Consonant of the Verb loses its as-
piratIOn after this ConJ'unction ; as 6 nam bithinn· {fl
were ,· ⁶ nan tuiteadh a’ chraobh’ gf the tree slzoubifizll.

⁶ Ged’, or ⁶ ge’ although, is used before the Present
and Pret. Affirmative, the Fut. Negative, and the Pret.
Subjunctive; as ⁶ ged tha e’ tkouylc he be ,· ⁶ ged bha
mi' thouylt I was ; ⁶ ge do bhuail thu mi' thouyk you
struck me ; 6 ged bhuail thu mi' tkouylt you struae me;

⁶ ged bheireadh e dhomh’ tlcouyh ΙιερεΙιοιιίἅ yive me„
