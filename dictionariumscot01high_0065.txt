In forming compound words, a Rule of very gene-
ral application, is, that when the subjunctive term
begins with a Consonant, it is aspirated. From this
Rule, however, are to be exceptetl, 1. VVords begin-
ning with s followed by a mute, which never admit
the aspirate3 2. Words beginning with a Lingual
when the Propositive term ends in n ; 3. A few other
instances in which there is an euphonic agreement
between the Consonants thus brought into apposi-
ti0n, which would be violated if either of them were
aspirated. ,

These observations will be found exemplified in the
following Compounds.
