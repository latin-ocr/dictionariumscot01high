Tbe- present affirmative ‘ ta’ is now for most part
written ‘ tha‘. This is one of many instances where
there appears a propensity in those who speak the
Gaelic‚ to attenuate its articulations by aspiration.
Another corrupt way of writing ‘ ta’ which has be-
come common, is ⁴ ata’. This has probably taken
its rise from uniting the relative to the verb; as ‘ an
uair ata mi’; instead of ‘ an uair α td, ἃς. ‘ mar
α ια’, ἃς. Or perhaps it may have proceeded from
a too compliant regard to a provincial pronuncia-
tion.

The preterite negative ‘ robh’ appears to be made
up of the verbal particle ‘ ro’, the sam-e with ‘ do‘,
and ‘ bha', throwing away the last vowel ; ‘ ro bha,
robh'.

The verb and pronoun of the lst person singular,
and Sd person plural, are frequently incorporated in-
to one word, and written ‘ taim’‚ I am, ‘ taid’they
are.

The present negative loses the initial hh after the
particles ‘cha’ not, ‘ mur' {f not, 'nach' that ηοι,· 72
is inserted, euphonioe eausa, betwixt the particle ⁴ cha’
and the verb; as ‘ cha ’n 'eil, mur 'eil, nach ’eil'.

This Tense is often pronounced ‘ beil' after the par· ,

tiele ‘ am' ς as ‘ am beil e’? is it?

Initial b of the future negative is aspirated after
the particle ‘ cha’ mn,- as ‘ cha bhi'.

Initial bh of the preterite subjunctive, loses the as-
piration after the particles ⁴ ni' not, ‘ mur' {f not,
⁴ nach’ that not, ‘ gu’ that, ὅ nam' {f} as ‘ mur bith-
inn, narn bitheadh tu’.

The subjunctive and imperative often suffer a con-
trac-tion, by changing ithea into 2'0; as ‘ biom, bios,
bindh' ἃς.

Some of the compound tenses of ‘ Bi’ are rarely,

they correspond to the analogy of other verbs ; and
