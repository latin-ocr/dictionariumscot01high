GAELIC GRAMMAR.

PART Ι.

OF PRONUNCIATION AND ORTHOGRAPHY.

THE Gaelic alphabet consists of eighteen letters z
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, 11, i, 1, m, n, 0, p, 1·,Vs, t, u.
Of these, five are vowels‚ 3, e, i, 0, u; the rest con-
sonants.

Beside the common division of the letters into
vowels and consonants, it is found convenient to
adopt some further subdivisions.

The vowels are divided into broad and small. A,
o, u, are called broad vowels 3 e, i, small vowels.

The consonants are divided into Illutes and Liquids:
Mutes, b, c, d, f, g, m, p, t. Liquids, 1, 11, r, s. They
are also divided into Labials‚ Palatals, and Liozyuals ,-
so named from the organs employed in pronouncing
them ι Labials, 1), f, m, p z Palatals, c, g: Linyuals,
d, l, n, r, 5, t.

The aspirate Ιι is not included in any of these di-
Visions.

OF THE SOUNDS OF THE VOWELS.

All the vowels are sometimes long, sometimes
short. A long vowel is marked with an accent,
especially when the qumztily of the vowel dev
termines the meaning of the word3 as ‘ bas’ death,
⁴ sail‘ tlte heel, ⁴ caraid’ a pair, ⁴ rIs‘ aqam, ⁴ mo’
more, ⁴ ldn’ a marsll ,· which are distinguished by the
accent alone from 6 bas’ the palm of the hand, 6 sail’
a beam, ⁴ caraid' α friend, ⁴ ris' to, lon’ the elle.

All the vowels, but especially the broad ones, have
somewhat ofa nasal sound when preceded or follow-
ed by τη, mh, n, nn. No vowels are doubled in the
same syllable like ee, oo, in English.

Inxaljtposlt all polysyllables, excepting·some words

compounded with a preposition, the accent falls on
the first syllable. The other syllables are short and
unaccented; and the vowels in that situation have,
in general, the same short obscure sound. Hence it
happens that the broad vowels, in these syllables, are
often used indiscriminately.

There is no quiescent final vowel.

A 1135 three sounds.

(1). The first is both long and short; long, like a
in the English words far, stam as ⁴ ἆτ’ slauyllcer,
⁴ ath’ α fhrd, 6 gradh’ love, ⁴ sai-uich‘ oppress .· short,
like a in that ; as 6 cath’ a battle, ⁴ alt’ α joint,
⁴ abuich’ ripe.

(⁴2). Both long and short, before dh and yle. This
sound has none like it in English. Long; as ⁴ adhlaic’
bury, adhradh' worship.- short; as ⁴ lagh’ a law,
⁴ magh' a field, adharc' α horn.

(3). Short and obscure, like e in mother ; as ⁴ an’ ‘a'
the, ⁴ ar’ our, ¹ ma' if, and in the plural termination
⁴ a' or 6 an'.

E

Ε 1135 three sounds.

(1). Both long and short: long, like e in where,
there; as ⁶52, se’ lie, ⁴ re' duriny. This eis gene-
rally marked with a grave accent. Short, like e in
met5 as ⁴ ie’ with, ⁴ leth' half
