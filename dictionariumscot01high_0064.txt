CHAP. 11.—OF COMPOSITION.

All compound words in Gaelic consist of two com-
ponent pens, exclusive of the derivative terminations
enumerated in the preceding Chapter. Of these com-
ponent parm, the former may be conveniently named
the l'repositive, the latter the Subjunctive term. It
sometimes happens, though rarely, that the the Sub-
jnnctivc term also is a compound word, which must
itsell' he decompounded in order to find out the
Root.

In coxnpounding words, the usual mode has been,
to prolix to the term denoting the principal idea, the
word denoting the accessory idea, or circumstance by
which the signification of the principal word¹ is modi-
lied. Accordingly we find Nouns, Adjectives, and
Vcrhs modilicd by prefixing to them a Noun, an Ad-
jcctive, a Verb, or a I'rcposition.
