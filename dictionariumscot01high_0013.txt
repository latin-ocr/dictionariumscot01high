Iris fit the Public should be intbrined, by the HlonLAND Socmry OF ὃςοΤιΑΝΙ),
that in the prosecution of this undertaking, their Committee have availed themselves
of the labours of those learned persons, whom, after much inquiry, they conceived to
be best qualified forits various duties. The general conduct of the Work was in-
trusted to the Rev. Dr. JOHN MACLEOD, Minister of Dundonald, to whose ability
and learning, the Committee have considered themselves bound to offer their tribute
of just praise. In the details of some of its departments‚ he was assisted by the
late Mr. EWEN MACLACHLAN of Aberdeen, the late Rev. Dr. ALEXANDER Invmi:
of Little Dunkeld‚ and the Rev. ALEXANDER MACDONALD at Crieff. In its pro-2
gress through the Press, it has been superintended and corrected by the Rev. MAcm-
TOSH MACKAY, now Minister of Laggan3 and it is only just to add, that in its present
form, the Gaelic Dictionary is much indebted to his indefatigable labours, and that his
philological acuteness and learning have greatly contributed to render it more accurate

and complete.
