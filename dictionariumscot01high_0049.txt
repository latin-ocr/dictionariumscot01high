Compound Tenses.

The compound Tenses qs the first order are made
up of the several simple Tenses of the auxiliary verb
‘ Bi' be, and the Infinitive preceded by the Preposi-
tion ‘ ag’ at. Between two Consonants, ‘ ag' corn-
monly loses the 9, and is written a' ; as, ‘ tha iad a’
deanamh' they are doiny. Between two Vowels, the
a is dropped, and the .‘] is retained; as, ‘ta mi 'g
iarruidh’ I am ashinq. When preceded by a Con-
sonant‚ and followed by a Vowel‚ the Preposition is
written entire; as, ⁶ ta iad ag iarruidh' they are ash-
iny. When preceded by a Vowel, and followed by
a Consonant, it is often suppressed altogether3 as,
‘ ta mi deanamh’, Iam doing.

The compozmd T enses qs the second order are made
up of the simple Tenses of ‘ ΒΓ and the Infinitive
preceded by the Preposition ‘ air', after.

PASSIVE VOICE.
Simple T enses.

The Precen'te Affirm. and Negat. is formed from

the same Tense in the Active, by adding adh. The
Preter. Subj. adds teadh.

The Future is formed from the Fut. Act. by
changing the Terminations in the Affirm. and Subj.
into ar, (more properly far, as of old ;) and adding
the same syllable in the Negative.

The Imperaez've is formed from the Imperat. Act.
by adding to the second pers. sing. tar, thar, or ar.

The Partim'ple is formed by adding te to the Root.

There is no distinction of Number or Person in
the Tenses of the Passive Volce. ⁴

Verbs which suffer a syncope in the Infinitive, suf-
fer a like syncope in the Pret. Aff. and Neg. through-
out the Future Tense, and in the Imperative.

USE AND IMPORT oF THE MOODS AND TENSES.

The Affirmative or India-alive Mood expresses af-
firmation, and is used in affirmative propositions only ;
as, ‘ do bhuail mi' I struck, ‘ bha mi a' bualadh' I
was strikinq.

The Neqatc've or Interroqatz've Mood is used in
negative propositions and interrogative clauses, after
the Particles ‘ ni’ not, ‘ cha' not, ‘ nach' which not, that
not, not? ⁶ mur' {suom also, ‘ gu, gur’ that, ‘ an, am*
whether used relatively or interrogatively; as, ‘ cha
d' fholaich mi’ I did not hide, ‘ mur buail sinn' {f
we shall not strike, ⁵ nach robh iad’ that they were
not, · gu robh iad' that they were, ‘ am huail miP‘
shall I strike ?-It is used in the Future Tense after
‘ged' althougyh; as, ‘ ged bhuail e mi', thouyh he
strike me. ’

The Subjzmctive Mood is used in the Preterite,
either with or without conjunctions3 as, ‘ bhuailinn'
I would strihe, ‘ nam, mur, nach, &c- buailinn‘ tf,
unless, (ςέ. Ι should strihe. In the Future it is used
only after the conjunctions ‘ ma' if, ‘ 0’, o ’n, since,
and the Relative ‘ a’ expressed οι· understood; as,
‘ ma bhuaileas mi’ ‘f I shall strihe, ‘ am sear a bhuail-
‘ eas mi’ the man who will strihe me, or the man whom
I shall strihe ; ‘ an uair a bhuaileas mi’ ‘ tra bhuail-
‘ eas mi’ the time [in] which I shall strike, i. e. when
Ishall strihe‚· ‘ c'uin [cia hine] a bhuaileas mi'?
what [is] the time [in] which I shall strihe? i. e.
when shall I strike 52

The Imperatz've Mood expresses desire, whether
purpose, command, or request; as, ⁶ buaileam’ let
me strihe‚ ‘ buailibh' striks ye.

The Infinitive is, in all respects, a noun, denoting
the action or energy of the verb, and commonly pre-
ceded by a Preposition which marks the time of the
action; as, ⁶ ag bualadh' at strikiny. ‘ am bualadh'
the strikitzy, the threshiny. It assumes a regular geni-
tive case, ‘ bualadh’ g. s. ‘ bualaidh’; as ‘ urlar
⁶ bualaidh' a threshi1z9floor.—-Tlie Infinitive some-
tImes loses the termination, and is regularly declined
in its abridged form; thus, ‘ cruinnich' assemble, inf.
‘ cruinneachadh’ per. apocop. ‘ cruinneach’ g. s.
‘ cruinnich’.

The Infinitive Mood has been denominated in the
present work, the present participle, from the consi—
deration of its being regularly so used, preceded
by the Preposition ‘ ag' at, and preceded by ‘ air’
aster, regularly corresponding with the past partici-
ple, as used in the English and Latin languages ; as,
‘ ag bualadh’ at strikinq, or strikiny ,- ‘ air bualadh’
after strikiny. or struck.

Many words expressing state or action, take the
Preposition aq before them, and may be considered
as present participle Verbs, whereof the other parts are
not in use3 as, ⁶ ag atharrais’ mimickinq, ‘ ag gair-
