ΤΟ THE KING. 4ῦί

SIRE‚

IN the name of the HIGHLAND SocmTY of Scormxm,
I present to YotJR MAJESTY the result of an undertaking already sanc-
tioned by Youn MAJESTY'S approbationi, and which Youn MAJESTY has
deigned to regard as a laudable attempt to record and illustrate the Ab-

original Language of this portion of Y OUR MAJEsTY’s Dominions.

In patronising and supporting a work of this nature, the lWEMBERs of
the HIGHLAND SocOETY are persuaded, that they will not be thought to have
lost sight of those patriotic views and great public objects, for the promo-
tion of which their Association was originally formed, and in the assiduous
prosecution of which they have been signally encouraged and sustained by

Yotm MAJESTY’S gracious Countenance and Protection.—I am,
SIRE‚
Youn MAJEsTY’s

Most faithful Subject,

And most dutiful Servant,

HAMILTON & BRANDON,

PRESJDENT.
