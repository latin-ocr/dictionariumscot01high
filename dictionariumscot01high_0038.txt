small vowel ς as ‘piobair' m. apiper, n. p. ‘piobairean’;

Lasair, Γ. astante, g.s. lasrach, n. p. lasraichean.

Of the Initial form qs Nouus.

In nouns beginning with a consonant, all the cases
admit of the aspiratedsorm. In the vocative singular
and plural the aspi1·ated·form alone is used; except
in nouns beginning with a lingual, which are general·
ly iu the primary form, when preceded by a lingua} ;
as 4 a sheann duine’ old man. Nouns beginning
with s followed by a mute consonant have no aspira-
ted form, because s in that situation does not admit
of the aspirate. In nouns beginning with l, n, r, a
distinction is uniformly observed in pronouncing the
initial consonant, corresponding precisely to the dis-
tinction of primary and aspirated forms in nouns. be-
ginning with other consonants. This distinction has
already been fully stated in treating of pronunciation.

The general use of the singular and plural num-
bers has been already mentioned. A remarkable
exception occurs in the Gaelic. When the numerals
4 fichead' twenty, ‘ ceud’ α hundred, 4 mile’ a thousand,
are prefixed to a noun; the noun is not put in the
plural, but in the singular number, and admits no va—
riation of case. The termination of a noun preceded
by 4 da’ two, is the same with that of the dative sin-
galar, except when the noun is governed in tbe geni-
tive case, and then it is put in the genitive plura13
when preceded by 4 fichead, ceud’, &c. the termina-
tion is that of the nominative singular; thus, ‘ da
laimh' two hands, 4 da chluais’ two ears, ‘ da fhear’ two
men, 4 fichead lamh’ twmty hands, 4 ceud fear' a hun-
dred men, 4 mile caora’ a thousand sheep, 4 deich mile
bliadhna' ten thousand ¹year-r.

 

CHAP. III.—OF ADJECTIVES.

AN Adjective is a word used along with a noun, to
express some quality of the person or thing signified
by thc noun. Ι

Adjcctives undergo changes which mark their re-
lation to other words. These changes are made, like
those on noum, partly on the beginning, and partly
on thc termination; and may be fitly denominated
by the same names. The changes on the beginning
arc made by aspirating an initial consonant. The
numbers and cases, like those of nouns, are distin-
guished hy changes on the termination. The genden-
is marked partly by the initial form⁷ partly by the
tcrnnnation.

Adjcctivcs whereof the characteristic vowel is
broad, follow, in most ol' their inflections, the form of
nonus. os the lii-st dcclcnsion; and may be termed
Adjcctircs ol' the first (lcclcnsion. These adjectives
whcrcos the characteristic vowel is small, may be
calla-11 Adjcctivcs of the second declension.
