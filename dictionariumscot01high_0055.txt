CHAP. VIL—OF PREPOSITIONS.

Tm: Prepositions, strictly so called, are single
words, most of them monosyllables‚ employed to
mark relation. Relation is also expressed by combi-
nations of words, which often correspond to simple
prepositions in other languages. These combinations
are, not improperly, ranked among the prepositions.
The following list contain, first, the Prepositions pro-
perly so called, which are all simple; secondly, im-
proper Prepositions, which, with one or two excep-
tions, seem all to be made up of a simple Preposition
and a Noun.

ΟΕ THE PARTS OF SPEECH- 27

The Preposition ‘ ann' is often written double:
‘ ann an eolas’ z'n knowledqe, ‘ ann an gliocas’ in wis-
dom. The final n or nn is changed into m before a
labial, as ‘ am mcasg' antony, ‘ ann am meadhon' iu
midst. 'Before the Article or the Relative, this Pre-
position is written ⁴ anns', as ‘ anns an toiseach' in
tlte beqimzinq, ‘ an cor anns am bheil e' tlze condition
in wlticlc lae is; and in this situation, the letters ann
are often dropped, and the s alone retained, as ‘ 's an
toiseach’ in tlte beyinm'ny.

The Preposition ⁴ do', like the verbal particle, and
the Possessive Pronoun of the same sound, loses the
ο before a vowel, and the consonant is aspirated,
thus; ‘ dh' Albainn' to Scotlcmd. It is also preceded
sometimes by the vowel a when it follows a final
consonant; as ‘ dol a dh’ Eirin’ qoiny to Irelami.
‘ Do’, as has been already observed, often loses the
d altogether, and is written a ; as ‘ dol a Dhuneidin'
qoinq to Edinburqh.

The manner of eombining these prepositions with
nouns will be shewn in treating of Syntax. The
manner of combining them with the personal pro-
nouns must be explained in this place, because in
that connection they appear in a form somewhat dif-
ferent srom their radical form. A Proper Preposition
is joined to a Personal Pronoun, by incorporating
both into one word; commonly with some change on
the Preposition, or on the Pronoun, or on both.

The following are the Prepositions which admit of
this kind of combination, incorporated with the seve·
ral Personal Pronouns.
