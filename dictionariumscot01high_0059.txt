The Initial form of Adjectives immediately pre-
ceded by the Attide, follows the same rules with the
Initial form of Nouns.

Besides the common use of the Article as a Defi-

nitive to ascertain individual objects‚ it is used in fl

Gaellc ;

l. Before a Noun followed by the Pronouns so,
sin, or ’κώ- 35 ‘ am fear so’ this man, ‘ an tigh ud'
yon house.

52. Before a Noun preceded by the Verb Is and
an Adjective ; as ‘ is maith an sealgair e' he isa qood
huntsman, ‘ bu luath an coisiche e' he was α swg'ft
sootman.

3. Before some names of countries; as ‘ righ na
Spainne’ the hiny of Spain, ‘ chaidh e do ’n Fhraine⁷

‘ an treas Iatha' the third days ; iomadh duine' many

Except such instances as the following; ‘ Righ Tear-
‘ lach a h-aon' Kiny Charles the First, ‘ Righ Seu—
‘ mas a cuig' Κὶηῃ James the Fz‘filz.

2. The possessive pronouns ‘ mo, do’, διο. are al-
ways placed before their nouns 3 as, ⁶ mo lamh' my
hand--The interrogatives ⁶ co, cia', &c. are placed
before their 11011115, with the article intervening; as,
‘ cia am fear ?’ which mem .9

3. Some adjectives of one syllable are usually
placed before their Nouns ; 35, ⁶ deadh dhuine' ιι
qood man, ‘ droch ghniomh⁷ a bad action, ‘ seann
‘ sluagh', old people. Such Adjectives, placed before
their Nouus, often combine with them, so as to re·
present one complex idea, rather than two distinct
ones; and the adjective and noun, 111 that situation,
may rather be considered as one complex term, than
as two distinct words, and written accordingly; as,
⁶ oigfhear’ a young] man, ⁶ og bhean' α youny wo-
man, ‘ garbh chriochan' rude regions.

Form.

Though a Gaelic Adjective possesses a variety ot·
Forrns, yet its form is not always determined by the
Noun whose signification it modifies. The form of
the Adjective depends on its Noun, when it imme-
diately follows the Noun, or only with the interven-
tion of an intensative Particle, ‘ ro, gle', διε. and
when both the Noun and the Adjective are in the
Subject, or both in the Predicate, or in the same
clause or member of a sentence. In all other situa-
tions, the form of the Adjective does in no respect
depend on the Noun; or, in other words, the Ad-
jective does not agree with the Noun.

1. When 311 Adjective and Noun are so situated
and related, that an agreement takes place between
them, then the Adjective agrees with its noun in
Gender, Number‚ and Case. A Noun preceded by
the Numeral ‘ da' two, though it be in the SIngular
Number, takes an Adjective in the Plural; as ί da
iasg bheaga’ two small fishes. The Initial form of the
Adjective depends partly on the Gender of the Noun,
partly on its Termination, and partly on its being
preceded by the Article.

The following examples of an Adjective declined
along with its Noun, exhibit the varities in the Ini-
tial form, as well as in the Termination of the Ad-
JectIve.

fies are in the same clause or member of a sentence, ¹

the AdJective is usually placed after its Noun; as,
⁵ ceann liath’‚ α hoary head, ⁴ duine ro ghlic‘ a very
wine mma. If they be in different clauses, or if the
one be in the subject, and the other in the predicate
of 3 proposition, this rule does not apply; as, ‘ is
‘ glic an duine sin’ that is a wisc man, ‘ cha truagh
‘ leam do chor‘ I do not think your ease unfortunate.
1. Numerals, whether Cardinal or Ordinal, to
which add, ‘ iomadh' many, ‘ gach‘ every, are plac-
ed before their Nouus, 35, ⁸ tri laithean' three days,
