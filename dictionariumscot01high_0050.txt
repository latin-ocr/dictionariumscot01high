The Parh'm'ple passive is an adjective, denoting
the completion of the action or enei-gy expressed by
the verb; as, ‘ arbhar buailte’ thresked corn.

Τὴε Simple Tem-es which belong to all verbs are
the Preterite or Future3 besides which the verb ‘ Bi'
to be, and the defective verb ⁴ Is' Ι am, have a Pre-
's-ent Tense.

The Prema expresses present existence, state, or
energy.

The Preterile Affirmative and Neyatioe expresses
past time indefinitcly. The Preterite Suly'unccive cor-
responds to the English Tenses formed by the auxili-
aries, would, could, ἃς. In general it denotes that
the action or energy of the verb takes place eventu-
ally or conditionally. The Pret. Aff. or Neg. is used
sometimes in this sense, like the English, when the
Pret„ Subj. occurred in the preceding clause ofa sen·
tence; as, ‘ nain biodh tus' an so, cha d' fhuair mo
‘ bhrathair bais' {stltou ltadst been ltere, my brother
lead not [would not liat-e] died.

'l'he Fueure marks future time indefinitcly. This
'l'ense is used in a peculiar sense in Gaelic, to signi-
t'y that an action or event takes place uniformly‚ ha-
bitually‚ according to ordinary practice, or the course
ot* nature. Thus ; ‘ blessed is he that considerem the
‘ poor' expresscd according to the Gaelic idiom,
would be, ‘ blcssed is he that will considcr', ἃς. ‘ A
‘ wise son nmketlt a glad father} in Gaelic would run,
¹ a wise son munzun-d, &a ‘ Your patient, 1 am
‘ told, isin a bad way; he neither ety'oys rest, nor
⁴ talem,- mcdicinc. Nay, his situation is worse than you
‘know οΓς ycsterday, he became delirious, and is
‘ now almost unmanagcable; he losses his arms, and
‘ endeavours to beat every one within liis reachl In
‘ Gaelic, will enjoy-—will take—will loss—will endea-
‘ 'mlh'

ἸῚιιΙ ζὀηψοιιηιὶ Tonsos mark different modifications
ιη’ tinne, which will be easily understood by analys-
ing their component parts.

ln the Aeliu-e Γαῖα», the compound tenses of the
tirst order denote that the action is going on, but
not completa-(l at tlic timu,¹ speciticd by tlte auxiliary
verb, or its auljuncts; as, ‘ ta nii ag bualadh' I am
a! serilauq, i. c. I (ιηι striki7195 ‘ bha nii ag bualadh

from this form of expression, that striking is the ac.
tion of some agent different from the person struck.
It is equivalent to I have been struck, Je viens d’ ecre

frappe'.

A set of Compound Tenses, of a structure similar
to these last, having the preposition ‘ ag’, in place
of ‘ air', is sometimes used, and in a passive sense,
denoting that the action is μυίης on at the time mark-
ed by the auxiliary3 35, ‘ tha 'n tigh ’g a thogail’
tlte house is at its buildinq, i. e. α buildz'n9; ⁴ sea
‘ bliadhna agus da fhichead bha ’n teampull so ’g a
‘ thogail’ fhrty and six year-s· was this templo in build-
inq. ‘ Bha an crodh ’g an leigeadh’ the cows were a
milkinq. So in English, the book is a-printing; the
deed's a-doing nOW.’
