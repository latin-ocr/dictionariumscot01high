INTRODUCTION. xi

only to the philologist and the general scholar, but also to those natives of Scotland or
others, who might desire to become acquainted with the spoken language of the modern
Highlanders, or with the few works remaining in the dialect.

The student of languages need scarcely be told, that an important part of the structure
os any language, when written, is its system of orthography: and, in the Gaelic, it is
of more perhaps than ordinary consequence, that the orthography should be as much as
possible systematic and simplified. Its articulations and sounds are almost entirely different
from those of any other among the modern or ancient tongues of Europe 3 and though it
be not possible to represent sound, by any notation of letters, with sufficient accuracy and
plainness3 yet the greatest facility attainable, in the absence of oral communication, is
afforded by a regular system of such notation. It is in course of the use and cultivation
of languages by writing, that a system of orthography becomes fixed, and properly con-
ventional. Such a benefit, has been denied by circumstances to the Scoto-Gaelic3 its
written records being few, and the practice of writing it in latter times having been dis-
used, if we except the few volumes that in recent years have, from time to time, been
given to the public, of the native poetry and songs 3 wherein no system of orthography was
followed, because the reading or writing of Gaelic was unusual with the compilers. This
deficiency was happily and in a great measure, supplied by the translation of the Scrip-
tures, and the publication of them in Scoto-Gaelic‚ by the Society in Scotland for
Propagating Christian Knowledge. The system of orthography followed there, adopted,
as it was, by natives of intelligence and learning in the Scottish Highlands, and improv-
ed by successive editions of the Scriptures‚ has been strictly adhered to in the present
work. But when there was found to have existed any remarkable varieties in the spell-
ing of a word, at different times, or as spoken and pronounced in different districts of the
Highlands, these have been carefully enumerated3 and when they are widely different
in the leading or characteristic letters, the varieties are inserted in their proper alphabe-
tical places 3 and a reference is made to the standard word, under which their explanation
may be found. A few deviations from the given standard will be discovered 3 but
those who consult the work arc referred to the synopsis of Grammar prefixed, where
it is hoped their propriety has been vindicated. It must also be observed‚ that the ad-
herence to a standard orthography refers to the word, as entered in its alphabe-
tical place in the Vocabulary or Index Verborum. In the quotations or authorities ap-
pended, it has not been deemed expedient, always to reduce the words to the same stand-
ard, but rather to leave them occasionally in the shape, in which they were found3 when,
by so doing, they could, through the medium of the accompanying translations, be made
intelligible to the reader.

In the execution of the task assigned to the compilerS, it formed an important part of
their duty, to give, after the leading signification, the various derivative and secondary
meanings of each word: these have been given in English first, and next in Latin.
