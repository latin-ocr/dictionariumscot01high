ln most ot* these compound ternis, the fragments An cois,

of the Pronouns which enter into their composition,
especially those of the first and second Persons, are
very conspicuous. These fragments take after them
occasionally the emphatic syllables sa, san, ηε, in the
same manner as the Personal Pronouns themselves
do; as ‘ agam-sa* ιιι ME, ⁴ alge-san' aqHIM, ‘ uainn-e'
from US.

The two Prepositions ¹ de' and ‘ do' have long
been consounded together, both being written ‘ do.'
It can hardly be supposed that the composite words
‘ dhiom‚ dhiot', ἃς. would have been distinguished
from ‘ dhomh‚ dhuit'‚ ἃς. by orthography, pronuncia-
tion‚ and signification; if the Propositions, as well as
the Pronouns, which enter into the composition of
these words, had been originally the same. In
‘ dhiom'‚ διε. the initial Consouant is always followed
by a small Vowel. In ⁶ dhomh', ἃς. with one ex-
ception, it is followed by a broad Vowel.-chce it
is presumablc that the Preposition which is the root
of ‘ dhiom'‚ ἃς. must have had a small Vowel after
‹l‚· whereas the Root of ⁴ dhomh', ἃς. has a broad
Vowcl after (Ι.--6 Dc' is a proposition preserved in
Latin, (a lunguugc which has many marks of affinity
with the Gnelic‚) in the same sense which must have
belonged to the root os ‘ dhiom', ἃς. in Gaelic.
