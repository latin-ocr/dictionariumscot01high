nv INTRODUCTION.

the peculiarities of its expression also, into the other two. It was seen that this method
and stvle of translation might be deemed by many objectionable, as unpleasant in itself
both to the eve and ear of the reader in English or Latin 3 and by many it is considered
not the most successful mode of transferring the precise ideas of one language into ano-
ther, to attempt it by the most literal rendering ε 11111, when a difference of opinion exists on
a practical subject, decision is necessary in making a choice. It appeared to the conductors
of the present work, that a closely literal translation promised the greater utility3 and to
the candid mind no farther apology for that choice is necessary. They are aware that, iu
the Latin department of the translation, much offence may be given to the admirers of
that language ; and they are also conscious that literalism is closely allied to barbarism. But,
if even a charge of the latter be-frequently incurred‚ they see no cause to repent a temerity,
that may be termed innocuous 3 if, at that expense, the structure and character of the Scoto-
Gaelic, as a spoken and written dialect, have been more clearly elucidated for those, who
could not otherwise 110 furnis-hed with so close a view of its peculiarities and usage.
Another important and essential department of the work was, to trace and indicate the
etymology of words. It was judged by its concham-S, to be very inexpedient, to load the
work with etymologica] discussion 3 yet it seemed indispensable to its usefulness and inter-
est, that the etymology of the language, sofar as it could be distinctly traced, should form
a part of the plan: how far, in this department, the compilers have succeeded 111 thr-owing
any additional light upon the structure and elements of the Gaelic, may ¹be variously
appreciated. To subdue the excursiveness of fancy 111 an eagerness of etymological re-
search, has not been always found an easy task by those, who have given themselves with
any zeal to that interesting study. The original plan of the work having restrained the
compilers l'rom ample or lengthened discussion3 it was deemed advisable that, in noting
the etymology of words, they should confine themselves to the indication of such ety-
mons as were evidently and purely Gaelic: these will be found indicated within paren-
theses, and immediately following the insertion of the words in their grammatical struc-
ture. 'she compilers do not claim the merit of having pointed out the origin or struc-
ture of every word in their Voeabulary ; and they are sensible of being exposed to the charge
of having done so, 111 much fewer instances than might have been safely ventured. But, in
a language where etymologica} research has hitherto done so little, and where they were
left to the sole guidance of their own opinions upon this subject, they considered it better
not to venture rashly beyond bounds generally obvious and allowed. Connected with the
etymologieal department, or rather forming a portion of the same subject, was the collec-
tion and insertion os corresponding words of the same apparent origin, in the other dialects
of the Celtic. lt is well known to those who are conversant with philological science,
that the collecting ol' similar words 111 different dialects and languages, and append-
ing them, as either its kindred or descendants or parentage‚ to the word itself, is doing
bnt little towards the discovery of their actual origin, history and descent: with such
an attempt, however, the conductors ol' the present work had to satisfy themselves. To
