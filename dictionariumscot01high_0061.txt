PART 111.

but as it is the dam that is spoken of, the reference is
made by the Personal Ptonoun of the fem. genden—
‘ Ta gliocas air a fir-ennachadh leis a cloinn' Wisdom
isjusttfled by her children. ‘ Gliocas' is a masc. noun;
but as Wisdom is here personified as a female, the
regimen of the Possessive Pronoun is adapted to
that idea.

If the Antecedent be a sentence, or clause of a
sentence, the Pronoun is of the 3d Pers. Sing. Mas-
culine; as ‘dh' ith na ba caola suas na ba reamhra,
agus cha n-aithnichteadh orra e’ the lean cattle ate up
ohefat caule, and it could not be Imaum by them.

If the Antecedent be a collective Noun, the Pro-
noun is of the 3d Pers. Plur. as ‘ thoir aithne do 'n t-
sluagh, d' eagal gu 'm bris iad a steach’ charye thepeo-
ple lese they break in.

An Interrogative combined with a Persona] Pro-
noun, asks a question without the intervention of the
Substantive verb: as ‘ co mise ,Ψ who [am] 1? ‘ co
iad na daoine sin Ρ who [are] those men ? ‘ cia i
a' cheud aithne Υ which [is] the first command-
ment 5> In interrogations of this form, the noun is
sometimes preceded by the Personal Pronoun, and
sometimes not ; as ⁴ co e am sear ,Ψ who [is] the man ,9
¹ co am fear ?’ what man ,9 ‘ Co am fear 12’ is evidently
an incomplete sentence, like what man? in English.
The ellipsis may be supplied thus; ‘ co e am fear a
ta thu ciallachadh Ρ who is che man whom you mean ?
This example may be abridged into another common
interrogation, in which the Interrogative is immediate-
ly followed by the Relative; as ‘co a ta thu ciall-
achadh θ’ who [z's he] whom you mean 2 ‘clod a ta
‘ thu faieinn P‘ what [is it] that you see .9

In an interrogative sentence including a Personal
Pronoun and aNoun‚as‚ ‘co e amfear sinP' ifthe Noun
be restricted in its signification by some other words
connected with it, such as the Article‚ an Adjective‚

another Noun in the Genitive‚ or a relative clause;
then the Pronoun usually follows the Gender of the

Noun, or the Sex os the object signified by the Noun,
if the Gender does not correspond to it; as ‘ co e am
fear a theid a suas P· who is the man that shall ascend?
‘ co ι’ am boirionnach sin 5⁴* who is tluzc woman 52 ‘ cia
i a‘ cheud aithne P‘ which is the first command ‚P—If
the Noun be not so restricted, the Pronoun is of the
masculine gender ; as ‘ ciod e uchd-mhacachd ?’ what
is adoption ἓ ‘ ciod e urnuigh ?' what is prayer ,9

SECTION [V.

01⁷ THE AGREEMENT OF A VERB WlTH ITS NOMI-
NATIVE.

As the verb has no variation of form corresponding
to the Person or Number of its Nominative, the con-
nection between a Verb and its Nominative can be
marked only by its collocation. Little variety there-
fore is allowed in this respect. The Nominative, whe-
ther Noun or Pronoun, is ordinarily placed after the
verb ; as ⁶ tha mi' lam, ‘rugadh duine-cloinne’a man-
child is born. The Article or an Adjective, is fre-

Vol. Ι.

quently placed between the Verb andits Nominative ; as
‘ thainig an uair' the hom· is come ; aithrisear ‚iomadh
droch sgeul' many an evil tale will be told. Sometimes,
but more rarely, circumstances are expressed between
the Verb and its Nominative; as ‘ rugadh dhuinne, an
dmgh, ann am baile Dhaibhidh‚ an Slanuighean there
τε born to us, this day, in David's town, the Saviour.

The R'elatives ‘ a’ who, ‘ naeh' who not, are always
put before the verb ; as ‘ am fear a thuit’, the man who
fill ; ‘ am fear nach dean beud'‚ the man who will not
commit asaulc.

ln poetry, or poetical style, where inversion is al-
lowed, the Nominative is sometimes placed before the
Verb ; as ‘ doimhneachd na talmhainn ta ’ἡ a laimh'
in his hand is the depth of the earth.

In those Persons of the Verb in which the termi-
nations supply the place of the Personal Pronouns,
no Nominative is expressed along with the Verb.

The Infinitive often takes before it the Nominative
of the Agent; in which case the Preposition ‘ do' is
either expressed or understood before the Infinitive ;
as ‘feuch‚ cia meud a’ mhaith, braithre do bhi ’ἡ an
comhnuidh ann an sith rhelzold, how yreata qood z't is,
that brethren dwell in peace! ‘ Is e mi dh’ fhantuinn
’s an fheoil, a 's feumaile dhuibhse' my abidinq in the
flesh is more voeedfulfhr you.

SECTION V.

OF THE AGREEMENT OF ONE NOUN Wl'rH ANOTHER.

When in the same sentence, two or more Nouns,
applied as names to the same object, stand in the
same grammatical relation to other words; it should
naturally be expected that their Form, in so far as it
depends on that relation, should be the same 3 in other
words, that Nouns denoting the same object, and re-
lated alike to the governing word, should agree in
Case. This accordingly happens in Greek and Latin.
In Gaelic,where a variety of form gives room for the ap-
plication of the same rule, it has been followed in some
instances; as ‘ Donncha mac Chailein mhic Dhomh-
nuil' Duncan the son (ff Colin the son of Bonam,-
where the words ‘ Chailein‘ and ‘ mhic' denoting the
same person, and being alike related to the preceding
Noun ‘mac’ are on that account both in the same
Case. It must be acknowledged, however, that this
rule, obvious and natural as it is, has not been uni-
formly observed by the speakers of Gaelic. For ex-
ample; instead of ‘ mac Ioseiph an t-saoir' the son of
:Ioseph the carpenter, many would more readily say
⁴ mac Ioseiph an saor.’
