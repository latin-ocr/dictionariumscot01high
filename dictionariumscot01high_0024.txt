xvi IN TRODUCTION.

Thus, in each article or word, inserted in the V ocabulary of the first part of this
work, will be found, first, the word itself‚ with its leading inflections in abbreviated
form 3 then its translation into English and Latin3 next, an example or authority, with
reference to the source in the langnage from which it has been derived, translated
also into English and Latin3 following which, are introduced, when necessary to be no-
ticed‚ peculiar and idiomatic phrases and compounds in the Scoto-Gaelic language, also
t1·anslated; and in conclusion such affinities are appended‚ where they could be dis-
covered, as have been already mentioned. Though it is by study of the Grammar of the
Sento-Gaelic, that a knowledge of the inflections and srame-work of the language is
alone to be satisfactorily learned, it may here be expected that a few rules should be
given, to facilitate the progress of those who desire to peruse the work. It is in declin-
able words, that difficulties will occur to the reader. He will find Snbstantive Nouus
entered in their simple or nominative form, followed by the terminational genitive form,
and nominative plural termination ε where these inflections are irregular, they are entered
at length. Adjective Nouns are entered in their simple or positive state, followed by
their comparative degree, which is pointed out by its terminational form; and where
these are irregular, they are also entered at length. Pronouns‚ whether irregularly de-
clined or indeclinatae, are given at length in their several accidents. Of Verbs, the root
in Scoto-GaeIiC being always found in the second person singular of the imperative
mood, they have been introduced in that form ; and the translations are given in the cor-
responding pant of the English and Latin. The second person singular of the impe-
rative is immediately followed by the terminating syllable of the future indicative,
which joined to the imperative, first given, forms that other constituent part of the
vcrb; and then follows the initial form of the preterit indicative3 which, substituted for
the simple initia] form of the imperative, changes the imperative into the preterit tense
of the indicative ; :from which three are formed in Gaelic, the other parts of the verb : when
these also are irregular, they are exhibited at full length. The indeclinable words of the
langnage demand no special instruction for a consultation of the work with advantage.
But it may herc be advantageonsly hinted to the etymologist‚ that various enunciations, so
closely similar as to be only distinguishable by a native, are necessarily represented by
‹liss'ercnt combinations of consonants. Thus, of the consonants, cllz and gh, as well as ch
havc bnt one guttura} sonnd, approaching to the various sounds of the χ of the Greeks.
And os the simple vowel sounds, it may be remarked that, α, ο and u, when found in
terminational or penultimate ¹syllables¹ represent generally but the same sound3 it being
one characteristic of the Semo-(inclite, that all pcnultimate and tcrminational syllables of
words are but lighdy, if not impcrsectly pronouneed.

With respect to tht.¹ fnlncss of thc Voeahnlary ot'Gaelic words exhibited in the first part
osthe work, the condia-tois could neither expect nor the eompilcrs cngagc, that it should be
