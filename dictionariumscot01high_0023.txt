do more, to go into the history of words, forming a theory of supposable descent and
origin, with any reasonable appearance of consistency and stability, would require, not a
incre verbal knowledge of other dialects and languages, as derived from the hasty pe-
rusal of their various lexicons3 but a minute and a critical acquaintance with the Ian-
guages themselves, as spoken or written, and an intimacy with their several histories3
which it falls to the lot of very few, to have either leisure or opportunity or the means
of acquiring. It is only when furnished with extensive knowledge, and liberal views of
the history, the structure and the character of languages in general, that the etymo-
logist can approach his task with suitable preparation3 and that his labours may serve
to delight‚ to instruct, and enlighten the world. The conductors of this work, acknow-
ledging that they did not aspire to such a degree of eminence, judged that they would
at least be meritoriously engaged, in throwing facilities in the way of the more learned and
acute philologist3 and their labours will not have been lost, if they guide 011 his way the
pursuer of a more extensive and a higher career, in elucidating the history of the lan-
guages and nations of civilized Europe. Their principal care has been to discover and
select affinities to the words of the Scoto-Gaelic‚ in the other dialects of the Celtic;
especially in the Welsh‚ the Armoric and the Cornish. The close resemblance, in almost
all its words, of the Irish dialect with the Scoto-Gaelic, rendered it unnecessary, in their
vieW‚ to attend to affinities in the former. Nor have they confined themselves to
the dialects of the Celtic, in this department of bringing forward affinities: they could
not be insensible to the fact, that, with the dialects of the Celtic now spoken, much ofthe
Gothic stream of language has been mingled. While it was not their province to enter
upon the discussion, directly or otherwise, of the comparative antiquity, 01· the prevalent
claim to an after-influence, that either of those fountains of European speech possess in
forming the other 3 they viewed it as their business, in so far as lay within their reach, to
note the affinities with Scuto-Gaelic, which they were led to discover in the dialects of the
Gothic ; especially in the German, the Anglo-Saxon, the Scottish dialect ofthe Gothic, the
Swedish, the Danish and the Icelandic. Striking affinities from the Eastern languages, the
HebreW, Chaldee, Persic and Arabic, have also been sought for and are exhibited. In these
latter they are aware that, their investigations have been of a very limited nature ; and that,
in bringing forward the few facts they have produced, they have been taking but a glance at
one of the most curious‚ important and interesting subjects, that can engage the attention of
the philologist or the student of history. The words from the sources last mentioned,
quoted as instances of a striking affinity, are generally exhibited in their proper characters 3
and the student of Eastern languages is entitled to an apology⁸ if he do not always find
the notation of these characters correct. Errors have arisen from circumstances, which, in
the printing of the present work, and the sources from which the compilers took their au-
thorities, could not easily be avoided : the sources also whence affinities have been derived,
are regularly noted, being chiefly the various Lexicons to which they had access.
