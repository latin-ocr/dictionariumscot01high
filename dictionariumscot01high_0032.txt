PALATALS ΛΝΒ LINGUALS·

In treating of the Diphthongs (ai, ea, ei, ἃς.) ηο-
tice has been often taken of the powers of certain
vowels in niodil'ying the sound of ‚the adjoining Con-
sonants. This refers to a twofold mode ofpronounc-
ing the Palatal and Lingual Consonants‚ whether
plain or aspiruted. The difference between these
two modes ol' pronunciation is, in some Consonants,
abundantly striking; in others it is minute, but Suf-
ficiently discernible to an ear accustomed to the
(laelic. 'l'lie one οῖ’ these modes of articulation be-
longs to Palatals and Linguals‚ chiefly when connect-
ed witha broad i·owel; the other belongs to them
when connected with a small vowel. Hence, the
former may be called llic broad sound, the latter the

may be known, l'or the most part, by the relative si-
tuation ul' the letters.
