From the foregoing example it appears, that ¹the
Verb, 111 its reciprocating state, retains its original
form throughout its several Moods, Tenses, and Per-
sons. ln the simple Tenses, the Personal Pronoun
immediatelv following the Verb is the Nominative to
the Verb. ’ The same l’ronoun repeated is to be un-
derstood as in the objective state. The word ‘ t'ein'
corresponding to the English seffl accompanies the
last Pr0noun.

OF THE lMPERSONAL USE OF VERBS.

Intransitive Verbs, though they do not regularly
admit of 3 Passive Voice, yet are used impersonally
in the 311 Pers. Sing. os the Passive Tenses. This
iinpcrsonal use of the l'assive of intransitive Vei-bs is
founded on the same principle with the Latin Imper-
sonals concurritur, puynalum est, ἃς. which arc equi-
valent to concumusfit, Jutynufilcm est. So iu Gaelic,
[8103151031- 103111’ I will move, ‘gluaisfear ico* they
will more, · ghuill'eadh lcinn’ we «lid recep, ‘ fieb-
atur a nobis'. ‘ Cha bhithear suoi· o pheacadh' {ltere
amntem not sin.

'l'o the Class of Impersonals ought to be referred a
certain part ot' the Verh which has not yet been 111011-
11011011. It resembles in form the Fut. Negat. I’assive3
‘ 1111311031, faicear, t'aighear', 810. 111 signification, it is
,λι-1110, Prosunt, and Atlirinative. ln the course ofa
narrative, when the speaker wishes to enliven his
style hy representing the occurrent-cs narrated as
present, and passing actually in view; instead of the
l'reteritc Tenses, 110 adopts the Part ol' the Verb now
described, employing it inan impersonnl acceptation‚
without a Nominativc to it expresse-d. One 01· two
example-s will serve to exhibit the use und ell'ect of
this anomalous 'sensu—¹ Shuidh 311 dg bhean air

PART. 11
oF AuxutARY VERBS.

It has been already shown how ‘ bi' be, is used as
an Auxiliary in the declension of all verbs. There
are two other verbs which are occasionally employed
in a similar capacity3 the one with an Active‚ the
other with a Passive effect. These are ‘ dean‘ do
or make, and ‘ rach' 9⁰·

The simple tenses of ‘ dean’ combined with the
Infinitive of any verb, correspond to the English
auxiliary do, did. It sometimes adds to the emphasis,
but not to the sense. The following are examples of
this Auxiliary combined with the Infinitive of an
Inercmsitz've verb. ⁶ Rinn e seasamh’ lle made stand-

iny, i. e, he did stand ; ‘ dean suidhe' make sitting, i.'

e. sit down‚· ‘ dheanainn gul agus caoidh' I would
malie weepz‘ng] and lamentation, i. e. I would weep and
lament. The same arrangement takes place when the
Auxiliary is combined with the Infinitive of a Tran-
sitz've verb, accompanied by a possessive pronoun ; as
ί111111 e mo bhualadh' Ῑιε made my strikinq, i. e. Ite
made [or caused] the strikinq of me, or he did strike
me ,- ‘ cha dean mi do mholadh' I will not make your
praisiny, i. e. I will not praise you ,- ⁴ dean do gharadh'
make your warminy, ‘ dean do gharadh fein’ make
your own warminq, i. e. worm yourself.

The Simple Tenses of ί 13011’, combined with the
Infinitive ofa transitive verb, correspond to the Pas-
sive V oice of the verb ; as ‘ chaidh mo bhualadh'
1. my striking went, i. e. came to pass, or lmppeowd, equi-
i valent to, I was struck ,· ‘ rachadh do mharbhadh' your

killinq would huppen, i. e. you would be killed.

CHAP. VL—OF ADVERBS.

T HE number of simple Adverbs in Gaelic is but
small. Adverbial phrases, made up of two or
more words, are sufficiently numerous. Any adjec-
tive may be converted into an adverbial expression,
by prefixing to it the preposition ‘ gu' to ,· as ‘ firin-
neach’ true, ‘ gu firinneach‘ [correwondiny] to [what
is] true, mm το αληθες, i. e. truly.

Fa leth ; severally, individually.

(ile ; very.
¹ Gu beachd ; to observation, evidently, clearly.
(ju buileach ; to ffct, thoroughly, wholly.
Gu dearbh ; to conviction, truly, certainly.
Gu dcimhin 3 to assurance, assuredly, verily.
(iu lein altogether.
(iu 1οὀ1ς to sufficicncy, enough.
(iun arnharus3 without doubt, doubtless.

Gun 011ξιίι’11; without rese, incessantly, without hesi-
tation.

1 Lcth 111111 leth: half and half.

Le cheilc; with eaclt other, together.
Maraon ; 011 one, together, in concert.
Mur nn cendum in like mmmer, likewise.
Mur sin 3 as ιΙιιιι, 111 that manner.
