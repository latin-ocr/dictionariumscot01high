The Componnd tenses may be easily learned from
those of the Verb ‘ Buail' in the first Conjugation,
being formed exactly in the same manner.

FORMATION OF THE TENSES.
Of the Initial Form-

An initial consonant is aspirated in the Preterite
Tense, through all the Moods and Voices; except in
the Preterite Subjunctive aster the Particles ‘ ni,
mur, nach, gu, an, am.' An Initia} consonant is oc-
casionally aspirated in the Future Tense, and in the
Infinitive and Participle‚ indicating their connection
with the preceding word.

In the first Conjugation, ‘ do’ is prefixed to the
Pret. Aff. and Neg. Active and Passive. However,
it often is, and always may be, omitted before the
Pret. Aff. It is sometimes omitted in the Pret. Neg.
in verse, and in common conversation.—ln the se-
cond Conjugation, the same Particle ‘ do' is prefixed
to the Preterite through all the Moods and Voices,

 

OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH· 19

and to the Fut. Subj. excepting only the Subjunctive
Tenses after ‘ ni, mur, nach, gu, an, am.’ In this
Conjugation‚ ‘ do’ always loses the o to avoid a kia-
tus: and the d is aspirated in the Affirm. and Sub·
junct. Moods.

Of the T erminatio‘n.

In all regular Verbs, the Tei-minations adjected to
the Root are, strictly speaking, the same in Verbs
characterized by a broad vowel, and in Verbs cha-
racterized by a small vowel. But where the first
vowel of the Termination does not correspond in
quality to the last vowel of the Boot, it has become
the constant practice to insert in the Termination a
vowel of the requisite quality, in order to produce
this correspondence. Thus a varIety has been intro-
duced into the Terminations even of regular verbs,
prejudICial to the uniformity of inflection, and of no
use to ascertain either the sense οι· the pronunciation.
In the foregoing examples of regular Verbs, the com-
mon mode of Orthography has been followed ; but in
the following rules, the simple terminations only are
specified.

Acmvs Vo1CE.-—Simple Tenses.

The Theme or Root of the Vei-b is always found
in the second Person singular of the Imperative.

The Preterite Affirm. and Negat. is like the Roor,
and has no distinction of Number or Person. Iu
most of the editions of the Gaelic Psalins, some in-
flections of the Preterite have been admitted, with
good effect, from the Irish Verb ; such as, ‘ bhuaileas'
I struck, ‘ bhualis’ thou didsc strike, ‘ bhuaileamar'
we struck, ⁶ bhuaileadar’ they struck—The Pret. Subj.
is formed by adding to the Root inn for the first pers.
sing. and adh for the other persons. The first pers.
plur. also terminates in amaid.

The Fucure Affirm. adds idlz to the Root; in the
Negat. it is like the Root; and in the Subjunct. it
adds as. A poetic Future Tense terminating in (mn
or mm, is frequent in the Gaelic Psalrns; as ⁴ gair-
ionn’ will eall, ‘ seasfann’ will stand, ‘ do bheirionn'
will μέτε, &c- The Future has no distinction of
Number or Person.

In the Imperative Mood, the second pers. sing. is
the Root of the Verb. The other Persons are dis-

.tinguished by these terminations3 lst pers. sing. am,

3d pers. sing. adh, lst pers. plur. amaicl, Qd pers- plur.
iblz, 3d pers. plur. adh.

The terminations peculiar to the lst pers. sing. and
plur. of the Pret. Subj. and of the Imperat. supply
the place of the Personal Pronouns; as does also the
Termination of the Qd pers. plur. of the Imperative.

The Infinitive is variously formed.

General Rule. The Infinitive is formed by adding
adh to the Root; as ⁶ aom' bow, incline, Infin. ‘aom-
adh’; ‘ ith’ eat, Infin. ‘ itheadh:
